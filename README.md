## Uploading and serving font files

This is an example which ilustrates how to upload font files and serve its source. The project is using the `React Select` dependency because it was created in order to solve a styling problem in other bigger project.

## Why am I using chroma.js dependency ?

Because initially I have forked this project from this [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-select-example-mdhi5?file=/example.js) created by Phani Teja Komaravolu but I ended up changing everything given my needs.

## Usage

It should be simple:

- Fork, clone or download the project
- `npm install` and `npm start`
- Once you have it running you should be able to upload a font file and see it being displayed on the fonts list and individually styled.
- In case you don't have any font files in your device, please feel free to use the two samples on `/src/fonts`.
- Yeah, I like **Korn**. :)

**OBS.:** I didn't put much effort on neither validation nor styles so feel free to do it by yourself. The core attended my needs and helped me to solve the issue I had previously in the other project.
